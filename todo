    - ask gpt about tests form this article: https://www.kevinrchant.com/2024/08/30/
        - So not only data tests but for other elements as well

    - tests from fabric toolbox github

    - Read about pytest (and maybe other framewrks)

    - Build my own test based on pytest

You can split tests roughly into three layers:

Static tests: config, regex rules, Python code (no Fabric calls).

Deployment tests: does the deployment pipeline behave correctly?

Post-deployment tests: do the deployed artifacts and data behave correctly?
